1. Our UPS Account is associated with Amazon account, users need to sign up Amazon account to login UPS application.
2. If a user queries packageId that is not existed in our database, our backend will throw an exception.
    We have not handled the exception, but it will not ruin our functionality.
3. The front-end loggedin status is stored in browser's local storage. If the user closes website,
    the session will not persist.
4. The error handler in handling the communication between our Amazon and UPS backend is not completed enough,
    if the user returns package. The package info will still store in our database.
5. We have not done comprehensive server load testing. The server may not robust enough to maintain real industry request volume.
